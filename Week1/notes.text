1. JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
    The JVM is an abstract machine that enables your computer to run a Java program. "Write Once, Run Anywhere" principle.
2. JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
    The JRE provides the libraries, Java class files, and other resources required to run Java applications.  Without the JRE, we wouldn’t be able to run a Java program. 
3. JDK (Java Development Kit)
    It’s primarily used by developers to write, compile, and debug Java programs.

Core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts

1. Objects and Classes
Class: A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines a data structure by describing the attributes (fields) and behaviors (methods) that its objects will have.
Object: An object is an instance of a class. When you create an object, you allocate memory for its attributes and gain access to its behaviors as defined by the class.

2. Inheritance
Definition: Inheritance allows a class (called the child or subclass) to inherit attributes and behaviors from another class (called the parent or superclass). This promotes code reuse and hierarchical classification.
How it works: In Java, inheritance is achieved using the extends keyword.

2.1 Single Inheritance
Definition: A subclass inherits from only one superclass.

2.2 Multilevel Inheritance
Definition: A subclass inherits from another subclass, forming a chain of inheritance.
