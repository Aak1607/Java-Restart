Lambda Expressions
Definition: Lambda expressions provide a clear and concise way to represent a method interface using an expression.
They enable functional programming in Java.

Key Topics in Lambda Expressions
Syntax:
Basic syntax: (parameters) -> expression or (parameters) -> { statements; }
Example: (a, b) -> a + b

Functional Interfaces:
A functional interface is an interface with a single abstract method.
Lambda expressions implement the method defined by the functional interface.

Types of Lambda Expressions:
Zero parameter: () -> System.out.println("Hello World");
One parameter: (a) -> a * 2
Multiple parameters: (a, b) -> a + b

Use Cases:
Iterating over a collection: list.forEach(item -> System.out.println(item));
Event handling: button.addActionListener(e -> System.out.println("Button clicked"));

Collections
Definition: Collections are frameworks that provide an architecture to store and manipulate a group of objects. 
Java provides several classes and interfaces for collections to enhance programming flexibility and efficiency.

Common Collection Types:
List: An ordered collection (also known as a sequence). Examples: ArrayList, LinkedList.
Set: A collection that contains no duplicate elements. Examples: HashSet, TreeSet.
Map: An object that maps keys to values. Examples: HashMap, TreeMap.

Common Methods:

add(): Adds an element to the collection.
remove(): Removes an element from the collection.
contains(): Checks if an element exists in the collection.
size(): Returns the number of elements in the collection.
clear(): Removes all elements from the collection.

Iterator Interface
Iterator is an object that can be used to loop through collections.
As the name suggests, it is used to iterate over the elements. It is used to modify and iterate over the elements in a collection.

There are 3 methods in the Iterator interface:
-> public Object next()- It returns the next element in the collection. It throws the exception of 
          NoSuchElementException if there is no next element.
-> public void remove()- It removes the current element from the collection.
-> public boolean hasNext()- It returns true if there are more elements in the collection. Else, returns false.

Iterable Interface
The Iterable Interface allows the collection to be iterated over. 
The root interface for the entire collection framework is termed the Iterable Interface. 
The collection interface extends the iterable interface, hence the sub-classes of the collection interface also implement the iterable interface, i.e., it automatically becomes a part of the iterable interface.
Syntax:
Iterator <E> iterator()
